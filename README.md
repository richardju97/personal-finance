# personal-finance

This repository is for a personal 2 week challenge to build a develop an application for tracking and reporting personal finances. 

The reason for this project idea is due to my own personal dissatistfication with existing personal finance applications available. 

The goal is to not only build an application that I myself would use, but also learn additional tools used by industry (such as GoLang) while simulataneously applying financial domain knowledge that I've learned while working for a Tax Agency.
